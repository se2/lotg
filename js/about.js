Moreover, being a prospective doctor, the skills of compassion, communication, and direct patient care that I have developed through working with LOTG will help me serve my patients in the best possible way.

Along with this, I have a younger brother with autism, and I have seen firsthand the impact that such a community service can have on people with disabilities. I enjoy being a part of and contributing to this team, and offering whatever I can to this cause.",
